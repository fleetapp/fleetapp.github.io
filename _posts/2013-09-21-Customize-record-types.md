Driver training record types refer to courses designed for fleet drivers to improve driving skills, road safety, increase productivity, and ensure optimal fleet performance.  
We can add in training types as per our requirements.  
Go to **Settings**, select **Application settings** and from the left tab, select **Driver Training**
