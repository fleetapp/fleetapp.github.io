If we want details of a particular vehicle from the fleet, we use **Search** option from the **Vehicles** menu<br/>
![Search 1](/assets/images/tb/search_01.png)  

Enter partial or full vehicle id (from the list) to search for a specific vehicle.  

![Give parameters for seaching](/assets/images/tb/search_03.png)  

On giving the details, you will get a list of all the vehicles with that id.
