We can keep a track of all the drivers of the fleet.  
Select **Manage** from the menu and click on **Drivers.**  
![Selecting 'Drivers'](/assets/images/tb/driv_01.png)  
A driver can either be **Active**, **On leave** or **Terminated**-  
* **Active** means the driver is working.
* **On leave** means he is not working for the company at present, he might be on his leave or holidays.
* **Terminated** means the driver has left the company permanently and no loger works here.

On the new page, from the drop down box, select the new updated status, add the details regarding the leave(**On leave reason**) and the date of re-joining(**On leave until**).

The same system is used to update the status from **On leave** and **Terminated** to **Active** and vice versa.  
Click on **Save** to update is on the system.
