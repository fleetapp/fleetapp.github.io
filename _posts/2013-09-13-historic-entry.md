If a tyre is fitted and is taken off but the customer wants to keep records of the tyre, we can add an **Historic entry**  
Select **Manage** from the menu and click on **Tyres**  
![Selecting 'tyres'](/assets/images/tb/tyres.png)  
Select the tyre about which you want to add details. This tyre can be **Scrapped**, **Fitted** or **Spare**.  
Go to vehicle history, on the right you see - **+Add (backdated entry)**, select it.  
![Backdated- entry](/assets/images/tb/hist_01.png)  
You need to provide both - the **fitting details** and the **unfitting details**, the **vehicle details** and the **odometer readings**.
