We can keep a track of all the drivers of the fleet.  
Select **Manage** from the menu and click on **Drivers.**

On the left side, select **Search**.  
We can search the driver by three parameters:
* **Name**
* **Current Status**: Whether he is **Active**, **On leave** or **Terminated**.
* **License expiry**: Whether his license is valid or expired.
